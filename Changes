1.002  2011-11-21

 - Minor cleanups.
 - Scalar::Util::refaddr unreliable for identifying objects; use
   Object::ID::object_id instead.
 - (Addition Update) Support for the cert:key property, the inverse of
   cert:identity.
 - (Update) use 5.010
 - (Removal) Temporarily disable WWW::Finger stuff, as it's grown very
   stale.
 - (Packaging) Module::Package::RDF

1.001  2011-04-02
# Stable release.


1.001_02  2011-01-18

 - Clean up code; add accessors to peek at much of the module's internal
   data.
 - Move some obscure documentation to a separate file.
 - No longer use Crypt::OpenSSL::X509 and DateTime::Format::Strptime.
 - use Crypt::X509 '0.50'.

1.001_01  2010-09-19

 - Make WWW::Finger optional.
 - Remove dependencies on IPC::Open2, Encode and Carp.
 - Use Crypt::X509, Crypt::OpenSSL::X509, DateTime and
   DateTime::Format::Strptime to parse PEM-encoded certificates rather than
   relying on the OpenSSL command-line client.
 - use common::sense.

1.000  2010-07-25

 - Constructor returns an object where "->is_secure" is false rather than
   undef in the case of a certificate with no useful subjectAltName.
 - (Removal) No longer supports subjectAltName pointing at a
   foaf:OnlineAccount. subjectAltName is always assumed to point to a
   foaf:Agent.

1.00_03  2010-03-26

 - Rename new_smiple to new_unauthenticated and document its usage.
 - Rename verify_certificate_by_XXX functions to authenticate_by_XXX, make
   them share common code, document their usage.
 - Use Math::BigInt instead of string comparison for comparing big
   hexadecimal numbers.

1.00_02  2010-03-21

 - (Update) The rsa and cert vocabularies have been changed recently.

1.00_01  2010-02-10

 - Documentation improvements

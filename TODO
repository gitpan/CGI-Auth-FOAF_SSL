* Moosify (perhaps Any::Moose).
* On error, instead of returning undef from constructor, throw exception.
* Perhaps release as 2.000 due to inevitable API changes,
  or take a new distribution name (e.g. Web::ID).
* Remove dependency on CGI.pm.
* Cookie stuff could get moved into an optional Moose::Role.
